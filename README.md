This Repo holds all the data for both [rubysynth.fun](https://rubysynth.fun) and the presentation about it I gave at Euruko 2019 and a couple of other places.

The low level code now lives in it's own [project](https://github.com/halfbyte/ruby_synth_blocks) and [gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/synth_blocks).

The sound examples used in the presentation and on the website are generated with the code in [examples/](examples/).

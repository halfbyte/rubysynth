# RubySynth

RubySynth is a collection of DSP code snippets, held together with duct tape (as one does), to generate (electronic) music with pure Ruby.

I've built this for my Talk at Euruko 2019 in Rotterdam called "The musical Ruby". This website primarily acts as additional reading material for people who have seen the talk, either online or at the conference. You probably want to [start here](01_introduction.html)

You can find all source code, including the code for this website at [halfbyte/rubysynth](https://github.com/halfbyte/rubysynth) on GitHub.
